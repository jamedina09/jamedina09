:wave: **My GitHub profile** :wave:

Hello, my name is Jose Medina and I am a tropical ecologists trying to understand tropical forests dynamics. I use GitHub for two reasons:

1. To make the code that I use in my research publicly available.
2. To host my [.init](https://github.com/jamedina09/my_emacs) configuration file.
